This is a program that plays music on your computer if you provide the name.
Whether its through a command line argument, or a file listing all the names.

The program also allows for you to skip forward and backwards on tracks you've selected.

For Files:
When writing a list of music file names write a number at the top indicating the number of songs to be played before listing the songs.
See 'SongNames.txt' for an example
